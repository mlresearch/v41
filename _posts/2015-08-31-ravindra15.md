title: Shared Execution of Clustering Tasks
abstract: Clustering is a central problem in non-relational data analysis, with k-means
  being the most popular clustering  technique. In various scenarios, it may be necessary
  to perform clustering over the same input data multiple times – with  different
  values of k, different clustering attributes, or different initial centroids – before
  arriving at the final solution.  In this paper, we propose algorithms for parallel
  execution of multiple runs of k-means clustering in a way that achieves substantial
  savings of IO and processing resources. Proposed algorithms can easily be implemented
  over Hadoop/MapReduce, Spark,  etc., with savings in \textitmap and \textitreduce
  phases. Extensive performance evaluation using real-world datasets show  that the
  proposed algorithms result in up to 40% savings in response times when compared
  to other optimization techniques  proposed in literature as well as open-source
  implementations. The algorithms scale well with increasing data sizes, values  of
  k, and number of clustering tasks.
