title: Adaptive Stream Clustering Using Incremental Graph Maintenance
abstract: Challenges for clustering streaming data are getting continuously more sophisticated.  This
  trend is driven by the the emerging requirements of the application where those
  algorithms are used and the properties of the stream itself. Some of these properties
  are the continuous data arrival, the time-critical processing of objects, the evolution
  of the data streams, the presence  of outliers and the varying densities of the
  data. Due to the fact that the stream evolves continuously  in the process of its
  existence, it is crucial that the algorithm autonomously detects clusters of  arbitrary
  shape, with different densities, and varying number of clusters. Recently, the first
  hierarchical density-based stream clustering algorithm based on cluster stability,  called
  HASTREAM, was proposed. Although the algorithm was able to meet the above mentioned
  requirements,  it inherited the main drawback of density-based hierarchical clustering
  algorithms, namely the efficiency issues. In this paper we propose \textitI-HASTREAM,
  a first density-based hierarchical clustering algorithm that has considerably less
  computational time than HASTREAM. Our proposed method utilizes and introduces techniques
  from  the graph theory domain to devise an incremental update of the underlying
  model instead of repeatedly performing  the expensive calculations of the huge graph.
  Specifically the Primâ€™s algorithm for constructing the minimal spanning tree is
  adopted by introducing novel, incremental maintenance of the tree by vertex and
  edge insertion and deletion. The extensive experimental evaluation study on real
  world datasets shows that I-HASTREAM is considerably faster  than a state-of-the-art
  hierarchical density-based stream clustering approach while delivering almost the
  same clustering quality.
