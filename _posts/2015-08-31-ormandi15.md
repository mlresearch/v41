title: Scalable Multidimensional Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling on Spark
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating occurrence rates of rare events for
  extremely sparse data using pre-existing hierarchies and selected features to perform
  inference along multiple dimensions. In particular, we focus on the problem of estimating
  click rates for {Advertiser, Publisher, User} tuples where both the Advertisers
  and the Publishers are organized as hierarchies that  capture broad contextual information
  at different levels of granularities.  Typically, the click rates are low and the
  coverage of the hierarchies and dimensions is sparse. To overcome these difficulties,
  we decompose the joint prior of the three-dimensional  Click-Through-Rate (CTR)
  using tensor decomposition and propose a Multidimensional  Hierarchical Bayesian
  framework (abbreviated as MadHab). We set up a specific  framework of each dimension
  to model dimension-specific characteristics. More specifically, we consider the
  hierarchical beta process prior for the Advertiser dimension and for the Publisher
  dimension  respectively and a feature-dependent mixture model for the User dimension.  Besides
  the centralized implementation, we propose a distributed algorithm through Spark
  for inference which make the model highly scalable and suited for large scale data
  mining applications. We demonstrate that on a real world ads campaign platform our
  framework can  effectively discriminate extremely rare events in terms of their
  click propensity.
