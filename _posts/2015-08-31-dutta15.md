title: "{Interactive Visual Big Data Analytics for Large Area Farm Biosecurity Monitoring:
  i-EKbase System}"
abstract: 'In this industrial application paper a novel application of salad leaf
  disease detection has been developed using a combination of big data analytics and
  on field multi-dimensional sensing. We propose a cloud computing based intelligent
  big data analysis and interactive visual analytics platform to predict farm hot
  spots with high probability of potential biosecurity threats and early monitoring
  system aiming to save the farm from significant economic damage. '
