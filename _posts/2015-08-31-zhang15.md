title: Random Decision Hashing for Massive Data Learning
abstract: In the era of Big Data, the iterative nature of most traditional learning
  algorithms renders them increasingly  inefficient to address large learning problems.
  Random decision trees algorithm is an efficient and decent learning algorithm,  but
  the complexity of tree structure makes the algorithm inefficient for the big data
  problems. Inspired by the theoretical analyses of random decision trees, we propose
  a randomized algorithm for big data classification tasks based on unsupervised  locality
  sensitive hashing. Our algorithm is essentially non-iterative, very flexible to
  deploy over clusters of machines,  and thus able to handle large datasets efficiently.
  Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can easily
  scale up to millions of data samples and features while still achieves at most 17%
  and 800% improvement in accuracy and efficiency respectively with moderate memory
  consumption over existing algorithms.
