title: Taking machine learning research online with OpenML
abstract: OpenML is an online platform where scientists can automatically log and
  share machine learning data sets, code, and experiments, organize them online, and
  build directly on the work of others. It helps to automate many tedious aspects
  of research, is readily integrated into several machine learning tools, and offers
  easy-to-use APIs. It also enables large-scale and real-time collaboration, allowing
  researchers to share their very latest results, while keeping track of their impact
  and reuse. The combined and linked results provide a wealth of information to speed
  up research, assist people while analyzing data, or automate the process altogether.
