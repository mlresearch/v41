title: Anytime Concurrent Clustering of Multiple Streams with an Indexing Tree
abstract: 'With the advancement of data generation technologies such as sensor networks,
  multiple data streams are continuously generated.  Clustering multiple data streams
  is challenging as the requirement of clustering at anytime becomes more critical.
  We aim to cluster multiple data streams concurrently and in this paper we report
  our work in progress. ClusTree is an anytime clustering algorithm for a single stream.
  It uses a hierarchical tree structure to index micro-clusters, which are summary
  statistics for streaming data objects. We design a dynamic, concurrent indexing
  tree structure that extends the ClusTree structure  to achieve more granular micro
  clusters (summaries) of multiple streams  at any time. We devised algorithms to
  search, expand and update the hierarchical tree structure of storing micro clusters
  concurrently, along with an algorithm for anytime concurrent clustering of multiple
  streams.  As this is work in progress, we plan to test our proposed algorithms,
  on sensor data sets, and evaluate the space and time complexity of creating and
  accessing micro-clusters. We will also evaluate the quality of clustering in terms
  of number of created clusters and compare our technique with other approaches. '
